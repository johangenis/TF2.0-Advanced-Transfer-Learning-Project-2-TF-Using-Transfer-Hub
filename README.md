# PROBLEM STATEMENT
 - Transfer learning is a machine learning technique in which intelligence (i.e.: weights) from a base artificial neural network is being transferred to a new network as a starting point to perform a specific task.
 - Transfer learning is a key skill to acquire as a data scientist since it can dramatically reduce the computational time required if the network is being trained from scratch (i.e.: starting from purely random weights).
 - In this project, we are going to use a trained ANN known as MobileNet that come readily trained/available from TF 2.0 Hub
 - We are going to use TensorFlow Flowers dataset
 - This code is based on TensorFlow 2.0 Hub documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/images/hub_with_keras
